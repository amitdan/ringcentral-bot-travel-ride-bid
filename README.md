# ringcentral-bot-travel-ride-bid
Bot to bid travel rides from any corner of the city developed in PHP using botman framework


## Inspiration
We have built Travel Ride bid Bot. Bidding travel ride is one of the crucial aspect in travel or cab industry.

## What it does
Driver or Cab owner can bid for travel ride  through chat with Travel Ride bid Bot. Driver or Cab owner just need to share basic details along with bid amount with bot and done.
Bot will identify entry with minimum bid amount and will send sms notification to respective driver/cab owner.
